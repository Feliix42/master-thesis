% \chapter{Compiler Optimizations} % or: Transformations?
% \label{sec:transformations}

% - take the optimizations we've done and generalize them
% - give formal definitions of the optimizations if possible
%   - discuss the effect it has
%   - are the optimizations semantics preserving?
%   - is it *valid* to do these transformations?
% - discuss whether the optimizations have to be applied in certain order
