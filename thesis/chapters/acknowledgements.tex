\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acknowledgements}

This work would not exist, if it were not for the extensive support I received while writing it.
First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor, Sebastian Ertel, for supporting me while I researched this topic, encouraging me to continuously question the results I achieved and getting me back on track when I got lost in situations where nothing seemed to work.

My supervisors, Jeronimo Castrillon and Michael Roitzsch, who both encouraged me to take the time I needed to finish this thesis when I fell into the low that was the unexpected \emph{working from home} situation that costed me more time than I had anticipated.

Nancy for her continuous unconditional support while I worked through many nights when creativity struck me and I remained absent from numerous joint evenings.

And finally, the people at the chair for compiler construction for offering refreshing and creative inputs to my thesis, for showing me that research is fun and also for providing me with an office space to work in.
