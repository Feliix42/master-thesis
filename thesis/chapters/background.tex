% \label{sec:background}

% - present both Ohua and STM
%   - explain paradigms in detail (most people here don't know what stm is and how it works!)
%   - detail benefits and shortcomings of both
%   - Ohua: talk about the compiler, its stages and where optimizations hook in as this will be required information later on.
%   - STM: Detail that non-determinism is part of the execution model -> speculative parallelism
%       - make sure to thoroughly explain the concept of a transaction
%   - Ohua: detail determinism of the model if appropriate, but remember that this will also be discussed later on
% - explain Irregular Applications: They are different from the parallelizability problems we usually face as the input dictates the parallelism at runtime and the computing times!
%   - use: \label{sec:background:irregular}
